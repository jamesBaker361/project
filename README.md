## James Baker and Arnav Lohe Data Science Project

### Contents of this Repo:

#### Helpers: commodities.py, spy.py, testing.py, trading.py
commodities.py- this provides functionality to pull in data for the prices of the commodities, and then analyze the data for technical factors that we want to study
spy.py- pulls in data for the spy, which we're using as a benchmark to measure up against
trading.py- provides functionality for analyzing data and devleoping trading signals
testing.py- provides functionality for discovering which models are better

#### Examples: commoditiesnotebook.ipynb, testingnotebook.ipynb, tradingnotebook.ipynb
commoditiesnotebook.ipynb- shows off the dataframes generated by commodoties.py
testingnotebook.ipynb-shows an example using the functions for comparing models
tradingnotebook.ipynb- shows an example using the functions for generating trading signals from a strategy

#### Results: finaloutcome.ipynb
This is the result of running the model using the real data

#### Comparisons:
q_learning.ipynb, lstm.ipynb, hmm_strats.ipynb- used to generate and save dataframes as csvs with the respective performances of each strategy \n
q_results.csv,lstm_results.csv, hmm_results.csv-csvs showing the performance of trading each asset using a strategy generated by the respective model
comparisons.ipynb- compares and graphs results of trading each asset under each of the three models
